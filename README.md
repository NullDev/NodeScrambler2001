## OwO wats dis

This is a useless NodeJS Clone of [Syrapt0r](https://github.com/Syrapt0r)'s [WordScrambler2001](https://github.com/Syrapt0r/WordScrambler2001).

No, seriously. <br>
It's a completely unnecessary repository which makes me question my existence and everything I believed in. 

**For anyone comming across this repo:**

I'm sorry. No, really. <br>
If you question my sanity after reading everything here, thats perfectly normal. <br>
It all started by meming around with [@Syrapt0r](https://github.com/Syrapt0r) and uh... this happened. 

End of story ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

<hr>

**Why?** 

- Yes

<hr>

If you search for a strong and fast encrypter written in NodeJS, <br>
then keep on searching. You won't find it here. 

<hr>

## No seriously, what does it do?

Well... It uh... it encrypts messages by shifting them. 

This monoalphabetic substitution cipher works by replacing every letter in a string with the corresponding letter in the key alphabet, adding a changing offset.

## Dependencies

- all

([prompts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompts), [minimist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist) and [terminal-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminal-kit))

## How 2 instol

**Wait wait wait wait...**

You are completely sure you want to do this? Like... A 100% positive?

0. Open up your favourite terminal (and navigate somewhere you want to download the repository to) <br><br>
1. Make sure you have nodejs installed. Test by  entering <br>
$ `node -v` <br>
If this returns a version number, NodeJS is installed. **If not**, get NodeJS <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">here</a>. <br><br>
2. Clone the repository and navigate to it. If you have Git installed, type <br>
$ `git clone https://github.com/NLDev/NodeScrambler2001.git && cd NodeScrambler2001` <br>
If not, download it <a href="https://github.com/NLDev/NodeScrambler2001/archive/master.zip">here</a> and extract the ZIP file.<br>
Then navigate to the folder.<br><br>
3. Install all dependencies by typing <br>
$ `npm install`<br><br>
4. Finally: Start the thingy by typing <br>
$ `npm start`

<hr>

**Alternative to `npm start`:**

We actually have sum pretty neat command line args ;3 <br>
Yah I was surprised too...

| Argument | Alias | Description | Required | Default |
| -------- | ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| --help | -h | Displays the help menu | No | N/A |
| --message | -m | The message to en-/decrypt | Yes | N/A |
| --decrypt | -d | Decrypt the message | Yes | N/A |
| --encrypt | -e | Encrypt the message | Yes | N/A |
| --initshift | -i | This | No | 0 | 
| --shiftvalue | -s | That | No | 1 |
| --key | -k | The Key | No | random |
| --verbose | -v | Display additional informations | No | False |

**Example:**

Decrypt:

`$ node app.js -dvm "this is test" -i 0 -s 1 -k "am key"` 

same command but with alias:

`$ node app.js --decrypt --verbose --message "this is test" --initshift 0 --shiftvalue 1 --key "am key"`
